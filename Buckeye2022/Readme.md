## Write-ups

I made write-ups for all the challenges that I solved that were above 100pts worth at the end of the CTF :

- [angry](./Angry/): a reverse engineering challenge that suggested to use symbolic execution, but we did not use it
- [bonce](./Bonce/): a crypto challenge where text is encoded using very predictable "nonces"
- [fastfor](./FastFor/): a crypto challenge where one had to find an image with a Fourier transform close to another image
- [frog-universe](./FrogUniverse): an algorithmics challenge consisting in finding our way in a maze full of dangerous frogs and nebulas
